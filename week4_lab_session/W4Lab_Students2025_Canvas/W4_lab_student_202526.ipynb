    "# Edge detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab exercise, you will look at applying edge detectors to images and comparing two different methods. You will also learn how to write a function in Python and evaluate the difference when using an approximation for the calculation of a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we will assume that you are able to use Python, and understand its basic use. **You are asked to write a short (no more than 2 pages) report of your work**, answering specific questions, and showing example images. This work is not assessed (it will not count towards your module mark) but you will get formative feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three images are provided for the assignment, './cameraman.png','./circle.jpg','./mri2.jpg', please feel free to use **any of them** to explore the tasks. Following we take './cameraman.png' as an example.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will cover some basics regarding Python and Image Manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is importing the required packages. In this assignment we will be using [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/), [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/). Check that your environment is configured correctly by running the section below. "

Images can be displayed using the show_rgb_image helper function. Read through this function to understand how it works. We can also see the raw image data by printing the variable using ```print```. As can be seen, by default in Skimage image pixels are represented as bytes with a range of 0-255. Depending on the processing methods, consider a normalised version of the image in the [0.0, 1.0] range by dividing the image by its maximum intensity value.\n",
